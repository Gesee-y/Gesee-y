## About Me

I'm a fairly regular developer with an interest in low-level programming, optimizations, and other related topics.  
Driven by my love for games and the urge to make some myself.

## My Languages 

- Julia (primary language)  
- Rust  (learning)
- Nim  (learning)
- Python  
- GDScript  
- HTML  
- CSS  
- JavaScript  

## My Tools

- Godot 4  
- Gamemaker Studio 2
- Blender  

## Main Achievements

- **[Cruise](https://github.com/Gesee-y/Cruise)**: A game engine kernel developed in nim from scratch. It offers the necessary tools for anyone to build his own engine in no time. Offering a powerful ECS, rendering and windowing abstraction, CLI tools, events system, KV store, systems scheduling, ease of use.

- **[Cruise ECS]**: A powerful ECS based on FragmentVector, a chunk based sparse set. It offers a dual mode for sparse and dense entities, custom filters, introduce the ECS as a primitives to model multiple game architecture without duplications, high performances, eollback friendly and easy to use.

- **Numerous Julia packages**: an [event system](https://github.com/Gesee-y/EventNotifiers.jl), [tree structures](https://github.com/Gesee-y/NodeTree.jl), [game development mathematics library](https://github.com/Gesee-y/GDMathLib.jl), [behavior systems](https://github.com/Gesee-y/Arceus.jl) using bitboard and PEXT for trait matching, [Animation system](https://github.com/Gesee-y/ReAnimation.jl), [windowing abstraction](https://github.com/Gesee-y/Outdoors.jl), [rendering system](https://github.com/Gesee-y/Horizons.jl), etc. Each with his documentation and CI.

- A complete **[Undertale engine](https://github.com/Gesee-y/xxxxtale-engine)** built on Godot 4, featuring three games so far, designed with clean code principles, SOLID principles, and composition over inheritance.  

- Worked on **Versetale**, a full Deltarune fangame, as one of the main programmers in collaboration with musicians and artists.  
- **[Numerous LeetCode problems](https://github.com/Gesee-y/Leetcode-challenge)** solved in Rust, showcasing my understanding of algorithms and data structures.  
- And much more. feel free to explore my repositories.  

## Academic achievements

- Selected to represent my country in the French Mathematics Olympiad, though I did not reach the final phase.  
- Participated in the IMMC 2025 as part of the Cameroon team.  

## Current Studies

Currently, I am actively learning:

- Statistics and applied mathematics  
- Computer architecture  
- Law  
- General economics  
- Algorithms  

## Hobbies

When I'm not coding (which is already one of my favorite activities), I enjoy:

- Horror games  
- Basketball  
- Game music
