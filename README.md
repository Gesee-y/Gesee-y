## About Me

I'm a fairly regular developer with an interest in low-level programming, optimizations, and other related topics.  
I'm 18 years old and currently in my first year at the **National Advanced School of Engineering of Yaoundé**, studying Digital Humanities.  
I started coding at 15, driven by my love for games and my desire to create some myself.

## My Languages 

- Julia (primary language)  
- Rust  (learning)
- Nim  (learning)
- Python  
- GDScript  
- HTML  
- CSS  
- JavaScript  

## My Tools

- Godot 4  
- Gamemaker Studio 2
- Blender  

## Main Achievements

- **[ReactiveECS.jl](https://github.com/Gesee-y/ReactiveECS.jl)**: The fastest and most flexible ECS in Julia, built with reactive pipelines and a fragment vector storage model. Shows iteration speed similar to archetype ECS while offering faster random access and structural changes, finally softening the dilemma sparse set vs archetypes. 
- **[Cruise.jl](https://github.com/Gesee-y/Cruise.jl)**: A game engine developed entirely from scratch araoud plugin DAG (Direct Acyclic Graph) that handle dependencies and the game lifecycle. The engine allows to use multiple architectures at once (ECS, SceneTree, Dataflow or your own). I also created its **[rendering engine](https://github.com/Gesee-y/Horizons.jl)**, **[physics engine](https://github.com/Gesee-y/Interactions.jl)**, **[audio engine](https://github.com/Gesee-y/WavesFlow.jl)**, **[animation system](https://github.com/Gesee-y/ReAnimation.jl)**, and more.  
- **Numerous Julia packages**: an [event system](https://github.com/Gesee-y/EventNotifiers.jl), [tree structures](https://github.com/Gesee-y/NodeTree.jl), [game development mathematics library](https://github.com/Gesee-y/GDMathLib.jl), etc. Each with his documentation and CI. 
- A complete **[Undertale engine](https://github.com/Gesee-y/xxxxtale-engine)** built on Godot 4, featuring three games so far, designed with clean code principles, SOLID principles, and composition over inheritance.  
- Worked on **Versetale**, a full Deltarune fangame, as one of the main programmers in collaboration with musicians and artists.  
- **[Numerous LeetCode problems](https://github.com/Gesee-y/Leetcode-challenge)** solved in Rust, showcasing my understanding of algorithms and data structures.  
- And much more. feel free to explore my repositories.  

## Academic achievements

- Selected to represent my country in the French Mathematics Olympiad, though I did not reach the final phase.  
- Participated in the IMMC 2025 as part of the Cameroon team.  

## Current Studies

Currently, I am actively learning:

- Statistics and applied mathematics  
- Computer architecture  
- Law  
- General economics  
- Algorithms  

## Hobbies

When I'm not coding (which is already one of my favorite activities), I enjoy:

- Horror games  
- Basketball  
- Game music
